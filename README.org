#+title: NixStrap
* Why this exists
I just wanted save some time setting up virtual machine by these scripts.
This is highly inspired from Nixos & DTOS & Bugswriter's archlinux magic.
*NOTE:- These are supposed to be used only by me, Use only if you know what you are doing*
* Requirements
Just run this command in your arch based distro live environment before running the install Script
#+begin_src bash
pacman -Sy doasfstools arch-install-scripts wget archlinux-keyring
#+end_src
