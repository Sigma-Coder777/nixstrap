* Why this exists
I just wanted save some time setting up virtual machine by these scripts.
This is highly inspired from Nixos & DTOS & Bugswriter's archlinux magic.
*NOTE:- These are supposed to be used only by me, Use only if you know what you are doing*
* How it is supposed to be used
In theory you can install all distro in the repo from any distro
as long as you have arch-install-scripts & dosfstools installed on your system
But These are made to be run on arch linux (Based Distro / Vanilla)
* Requirements
Just run this command in your arch based distro live environment before running the install Script
#+begin_src bash
pacman -Sy doasfstools arch-install-scripts wget
#+end_src
